#### What Are Examples of Combining Machine Learning and Decision Intelligence Technology?

By combining machine learning with decision intelligence technology, you can identify the optimal way to achieve your goals, given your predicted future.

For example, imagine you’re planning a trip. A machine learning model can predict what you may encounter along your journey (weather, traffic, engine trouble). But with decision intelligence technology, you can take those predictions into consideration, as well as your goals (fastest, cheapest, safest route) and constraints (time, budget, speed limits, roadside services), and identify the single best route you should take.
 
**Use machine learning to predict	Use decision intelligence to identify**
A customer’s likelihood to buy more with targeted offers	Which discounts to offer, to which customers, to maximize profits
Supply chain issues, while there’s still time to remediate	The least costly way to reroute shipments
Who will launch a cyberattack, before it happens	Which investigators to assign to potential threats, based on investigator skill and potential damage
Experiments that are more likely to prove a hypothesis	Which experiments to pursue, based on talent, cost, and time
Imminent machine failure	When to shut down the production line for maintenance, so as to minimize costs and production disruptions
Price movements before the market does	How to allocate capital across all investment vehicles
